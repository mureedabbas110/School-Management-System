- **Swing** – GUI framework for building the application's interface  
- **AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)** – Used alongside Swing for GUI components  
- **MySQL** – Relational database for persistent storage  
- **JDBC** – Java Database Connectivity to interact with MySQL  
- **OOP Concepts** – Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Abstraction  
- **DBMS** – Structured design of database and relations  
- **Modern GUI Design** – Enhanced user experience using custom styling and layout
